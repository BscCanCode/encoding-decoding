# PyQuestEvolution - Word Encoder-Decoder v2 (Beginner Edition) - April 2025

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
An updated word encoder/decoder script, built in April 2025. It now supports multiple inputs via a loop, adds an exit option, and encodes/decodes words with random prefixes and suffixes.

## Why I Built This
- To improve my v1 encoder/decoder with a loop for multiple inputs.
- To practice user flow control with an exit option.
- To experiment with `string` and `random` modules.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Takes a word (e.g., "treordwert"), adds a random 3-letter prefix and suffix, and scrambles it (e.g., "XYZreordwertabc").
- Loops to allow multiple words, with options to decode, continue, or exit.
- Decodes back to the original word if "yes" is chosen (e.g., "treordwert").

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Adding a `while` loop for multiple inputs.
- Implementing an "exit" option for better user control.
- Using `string.ascii_letters` and `random.choices` for randomization.

---

## ðŸ”„ Updates from v1
- âœ… Added loop for multiple word inputs.
- âœ… Introduced "exit" option alongside yes/no.
