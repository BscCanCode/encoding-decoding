# Word Encoder-Decoder (Beginner Edition) - April 2025

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
A simple script to encode and decode words, built in April 2025. It adds random prefixes and suffixes to a word, scrambles it, and offers an option to decode it back.

## Why I Built This
- To experiment with string manipulation in Python.
- To use `random.choices` for generating random letters.
- To practice user input and conditional logic.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Takes a word (e.g., "treordwert").
- Encodes it by adding a 3-letter random prefix and suffix, and moves the first letter to the end (e.g., "xyzreordwertabc").
- Offers to decode the word back to the original (e.g., "treordwert").

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Using `string.ascii_lowercase` and `random.choices` for randomization.
- Basic string slicing and concatenation.
- Handling user choices with conditionals.

---

## ðŸ”„ Updates
- âœ… Implemented encoding with random prefix/suffix.
- âœ… Added decoding option with user input.
